## Project task
This project was a part of my university class, the task was to build a simple landing page for a charity.

## Project overview
It was a simple project, started out with the design, tried to keep it as simple as possible because in the end the project was for charity and the main focus should be to get the information out and not make some complex website. There were no outstanding problems here nor some special discovery of new stuff, I applied my previous knowledge to the best of my ability to make something simple work as it should.
